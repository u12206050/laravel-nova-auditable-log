# Resource Tool for Laravel Auditing

A Laravel Nova Resource Tool that allows you to easily display the audit log that is created by the [Laravel Auditing](http://www.laravel-auditing.com/) package (owen-it/laravel-auditing).

## Installation

Simply install using composer.

```bash

composer require day4/auditable-log

```

Then add the resource tool to a resource whose related model uses and implements the Laravel Auditable package.

```php

public function fields(Request $request)
{

  return [
    Text::make('Name'),
    Text::make('E-mail'),

    // Shows audit log button on detail view, which expands audit trail
    AuditableLog::make()
  ];

}

```

## Policies

There are two policy gates available that you can implement on your resources' policy.


```php
// Is the user able to access the audit log for this resource?
public function audit($loggedInUser, $resource) {
    return true;
}
```


```php
// Is the user able to restore values based on audits for this resource?
public function audit_restore($loggedInUser, $resource) {
    return true;
}
```
